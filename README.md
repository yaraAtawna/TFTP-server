# Extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) Server 
This project implements an extended TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server and client, allowing multiple users to upload and download files from the server and receive announcements when files are added or deleted. Communication between the server and clients is performed using a binary communication protocol that supports file upload, download, and lookup functionalities.
